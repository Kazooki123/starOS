# STAROS

An Operating System that is both compatible with Desktop PC and Mobile Devices!

## Introduction

For years the tech world has so many things to shown, like a website, new programming language,
new games, new pieces of software, etc.

Today we will discuss and learn the features, functionality and purpose of **starOs!**

## What is StarOs?

**StarOs** is Operating System that is both supported for Desktop AND Mobile devices. We planned and
constructed an OS that is both **_Open Source_** like **Android** & **Linux**, and has a rich user
experience and UI like **Windows** & **macOS/iOS**.

As a **_Solo Programmer_** I am making this for the sake of users online and to actually just cure my
boredom XD. However, **StarOS** also focuses on security and protection and prevention of malicious attackers
online, In early stages StarOS will have a robust functionality and a user-friendly experience for all!

## Is it for Gaming?

StarOS can be used for gaming as well! StarOS will have a preinstalled app/software that configures the
setting of your GPU, CPU & RAM to minimize and adjust your gaming experience!
